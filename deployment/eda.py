    distribution = {
        'Rented Bike Count': 'The `Rented Bike Count` column exhibits a positively skewed distribution, suggesting that the data is skewed to the left. The boxplot reveals numerous outliers in this column, with values exceeding 3500 bike rentals. It is assumed that these outliers occur due to specific events throughout the year, such as public holidays, which would naturally affect bike rental counts, leading to fluctuations. Typically, the bike rental count peaks within the range of 0 to 500 rentals.', 
        'Temperature': 'The `Temperature` column shows a normal distribution, indicating that the mean, median, mode value is similar and the data is pooled around the center. As observed in the boxplot, there are no outliers detected in this column. Moreover, the temperature values range from -20째C to 40째C, covering a wide span. This range indicates that the data encompasses the four seasons.', 
        'Humidity': 'The `Humidity` column shows a normal distribution, indicating that the mean, median, mode value is similar and the data is pooled around the center but slightly lean to the right. As observed in the boxplot, there are no outliers detected in this column. Moreover, we note that the data values range between 0% and 100%. The peaks of humidity in Seoul throughout the year fall within the range of 40% to 60%, indicating moderate humidity levels in the city.',
        'Wind Speed': 'The `Wind Speed` column shows a positive skewness distribution, indicating that the data is skewed towards the left. As observed in the boxplot, there are quite a lot of outliers in this column, with values significantly exceeding 7 m/s. Notably, the peak wind speed in Seoul throughout the year is around 1 m/s which we can infer as light breeze.', 
        'Visibility': 'The `Visibility` column shows a negative skewness distribution, indicating that the data is skewed towards the right. As observed in the boxplot, there are no outliers detected in this column, with values ranging from 0 to 20000 m of visibility. The visibility peaks in 20000 m or 20 km which considered as excellent visibility.', 
        'Dew Point Temperature': 'The `Dew Point Temperature` column shows a normal distribution, indicating that the mean, median, mode value is similar and the data is pooled around the center but slightly leans to the right. As observed in the boxplot, there are no outliers detected in this column. Additionally, we observe that the data values range between -30째C and 30째C.',
        'Solar Radiation': 'The `Solar Radiation` column shows a high positive skewness distribution, indicating that the data is skewed towards the left. As observed in the boxplot, there are a lot of outliers in this column, with values significantly exceeding 3.5 MJ/m2. Interestingly, solar radiation in Seoul throughout the year peaks at 0, indicating no solar radiation on a daily basis. However, considering that the dataset includes nighttime data as well, this explains why the solar radiation peaks at 0.', 
        'Rainfall': 'The `Rainfall` column shows a high positive skewness distribution, indicating that the data is skewed towards the left. As observed in the boxplot, there are numerous outliers in this column, with values significantly reaching 35 mm. Interestingly, rainfall in Seoul is mostly minimal, as indicated by the frequent occurrence of 0 mm data throughout the year. The most precipitation in the dataset period is nearly 35 mm which considered as moderate rain. However, the dataset also captures instances of moderate rainfall, with the highest recorded precipitation being nearly 35 mm.', 
        'Snowfall': 'The `Snowfall` column shows a high positive skewness distribution, indicating that the data is skewed towards the left. As observed in the boxplot, there are numerous outliers in this column, with values significantly exceeding 8 cm. The data is predominantly clustered around 0, which aligns with the presence of all four seasons in the dataset, and snowfall typically occurring only during winter.', 
        'Seasons': 'The `Seasons` column contains 4 unique values: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Each season accounts for approximately 25% of the data, indicating a balanced proportion. From this visualization, we can infer that the dataset consists of data for a single year (1 cycle of 4 seasons).',
        'Holiday': 'The `Holiday` column contains 2 unique values: Holiday and No Holiday. The percentage of "No Holiday" values (95.1%) is significantly higher than the percentage of "Holiday" values (4.9%), indicating an imbalanced proportion. This proportion makes sense as there are typically more non-holiday days in a year.', 
        'Functioning Day': 'The `Functioning Day` column contains 2 unique values: Yes and No. The percentage of "Yes" values (96.6%) is significantly higher than the percentage of "No" values (3.4%), indicating an imbalanced proportion. This proportion makes sense as there are typically more functioning days in a year.'
