# Seoul Bike Sharing Demand :bike:

This project involves supervised learning regression to forecast [bike sharing demand in Seoul](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand) throughout the year. The process included in this project consists of:  
1. **Introduction**  
Objectives and case study for this project.
2. **Basic Exploratory Data Analysis**  
Data distribution and Rented Bike Count correlation with other features.
3. **Feature Engineering**  
Cardinality, outliers, and missing value handling, feature selection, feature scalling, and feature encoding.
4. **Model Definition, Training, and Evaluation**  
Modelling using 5 algorithms: KNN Regressor, SVR, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R2 Score.
5. **Conclusion**  
EDA and model conclusion.
6. **Model Inference**  
Predicting inference data using the best models.
7. **Model Deployment**  
All necessary files for model deployment using _Streamlit_ and [_HuggingFace_](https://huggingface.co/spaces/basyirasabita/seoul-bike-demand).
